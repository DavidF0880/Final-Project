# Final-Project
 I will be working with an e-sports dataset and find answers to some questions in mind.
Working with an E-Sports dataset is a dream! I have been a heavy video game fan since i can remember. E-Sports has been a growing platform and seeing what video games, players or teams have been creating a bigger impact in the industry. 

Questions for E Sports Data 

What direction is E-Sports taking? Create a predictive model to show earnings in later years of 2020-2030 

What E-Sports perform better? Showcase what E-Sports are generating most money.  

Showcase how players influence the game franchise.

What genre of video game has the highest earning teams/player?

How does winning tournaments influence the value of the teams/players?
